The S-classification scheme of the AWMF differentiates between the classes S1 treatment recommendation as well as S2e, S2k and S3 guideline.     The ""S"" stands for the extent of the applied systematic approach in the development process of a guideline.     Each class thus stands for a specific methodological concept that must be presented in a way that is comprehensible to the users.     The choice of class is based on the question of how much effort is appropriate and feasible.     The need for legitimacy for the implementation of the guideline (convincing the target group) must be taken into account.

The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.    Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode.

Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code ""potassium"" together with and Act.classCode for ""laboratory observation"" to somehow mean ""potassium laboratory observation"" and then use the same Act.code for ""potassium"" together with Act.classCode for ""medication"" to mean ""substitution of potassium"". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.","ValueSet/v3-ActCode"

The S-classification scheme of the AWMF differentiates between the classes S1 treatment recommendation as well as S2e, S2k and S3 guideline.     The ""S"" stands for the extent of the applied systematic approach in the development process of a guideline.     Each class thus stands for a specific methodological concept that must be presented in a way that is comprehensible to the users.     The choice of class is based on the question of how much effort is appropriate and feasible.     The need for legitimacy for the implementation of the guideline (convincing the target group) must be taken into account.     When choosing a higher S-classification in the context of updating a guideline, the adaptation to the corresponding methodology has to be considered.","ValueSet/vs-awmf-guideline-class"

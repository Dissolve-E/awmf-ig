","Group of multiple entities","Represents a defined collection of entities that may be discussed or acted upon collectively but which are not typically expected to act collectively.  These collections are also not typically formally or legally recognized.

NOTE: Group may be used to define families or households, which in some circumstances may act collectively or have a degree of legal or formal recognition.  This should be considered an exception.  When Group is used for types of entities other than Patient or RelatedPerson, the expectation remains that the Group will not act collectively or have formal recognition - use Organization if these behaviors are needed.

For example, it is possible for a 'family' Group to be a performer of an Observation or owner of a Task.  However, this is not permitted for a Group made up of Practitioners, PractitionerRoles or Organizations.  Organization or CareTeam would need to be used instead.  A Group of Practitioners could, however, be a subject of an Observation.","If both Group.characteristic and Group.member are present, then the members are the individuals who were found who met the characteristic.

Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.  This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions.

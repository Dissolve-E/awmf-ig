# The following constraints are failing due to the internal structure it seems, nothin that we can change ourselves?
Constraint failed: eld-20: 'The first component of the path should be UpperCamelCase. Additional components (following a '.') should be lowerCamelCase. If this syntax is not adhered to, code generation tools may be broken. Logical models may be less concerned about this implication.' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ElementDefinition)
Constraint failed: eld-31: 'additionalBindings should have a key' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ElementDefinition) (Best Practice Recommendation)
Constraint failed: eld-5: 'if the element definition has a contentReference, it cannot have type, defaultValue, fixed, pattern, example, minValue, maxValue, maxLength, or binding' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ElementDefinition)
